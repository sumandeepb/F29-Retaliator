## Some Background
The original F-29 Retaliator Game released in 1989 by Digital Ocean was one of the first computer games I ever played along with Alley Cat (1984), Prince of Persia (1989), and Wolfenstein 3D (1992). I was immediately hooked on to the 3D graphics and engaging flight combat, but beyond just playing the games and being content, I wanted to learn how to make my own. And so there I was, a 10 year old kid growing up in a suburb of Delhi, India embarking on my amazing journey into the world of computer programming and software technology.

It wasn't an easy or a short step to success, nor was it direct route but rather a criss cross wandering in and out of the unknown. My first PC was an outdated Olivetti with Intel i386SX 16-bit/25MHz processor with 2.64MB of RAM, and an 85MB hard disk with MS-DOS 6.22 and Windows 3.11 bought second hand from a scrap auction.

I started with QBasic in 1994, worked my way upto Turbo C++ by 1998, after completing high school in 2002, I started on my Electronics Engineering degree at IIT Kharagpur, and onto my career in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. I have built a lot of interesting projects and launched many products over the years, but somewhere in the back of my mind is the longing to go back to my roots and finish what started it all.

Therefore, as a tribute to the inspiration I recieved from this game, I have started work to recreate the game albeit with much more modern twist using C++ 17 and OpenGL 4.5, and coding on an Intel i5 64bit 6 Core 3.6GHz processor, with 32GB of RAM, 8GB graphics card, and a 750GB SSD.
